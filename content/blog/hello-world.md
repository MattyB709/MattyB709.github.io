Welcome to your minimalist blog. Keep writing.

Inline code like `const x = 1` works, and code blocks too:

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet('Vibe');
```

Inline math with $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ and a block below:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$
